title: What Does it Take to Innovate?

import Quote from '../lib/quote';

Innovation requires you to have the **will, courage, drive, and mindset to
innovate, along with a set of behavioral skills**. Without all of these things,
innovation will elude you or will be left to chance. If you don't believe you
are able to innovate and be creative. Without this courage, you will psych
yourself out and fail before you even start. This is called *Creative Confidence*,
and is a must for being able to innovate.

Innovators must be able to self-reflect and change themselves. A permanent
growth mindset allows you to constantly improve yourself. Hand in hand with this
is perpetually learning.

At its core, innovation is coming up with something new, whether its an idea,
a product, or a business structure. By definition, pushing the edge of human
knowledge and venturing into unknown realms is full of risk and unknowns.
Without the ability to take risks and recover from failures, innovation is
impossible. The [skills and mindset for innovation](#posts/3-how-do-innovators-think)
can only be realized with a foundation of confidence, resilience, and self-efficacy.
**Without the belief that you are able to change the world, you never will**. 
Steve Jobs, one of the greatest innovators of our time, says it better than I 
ever could.
<Quote author="Steve Jobs">

Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round
pegs in the square holes ... the ones who see things differently -- they're not
fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. ... You can quote
them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't
do is ignore them because they change things. ... They push the human race
forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because
the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the
ones who do.
