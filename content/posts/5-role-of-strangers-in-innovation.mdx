title: What Role Can Strangers Play in Innovation?
---

Every person we know besides our atomic family is a stranger to us at some point.
Engaging with strangers is a *must* if you want to expand your network - a
[must for innovators](#posts/3-how-do-innovators-think). However, networking is not the 
only benefit of talking to strangers. Strangers expose us to new viewpoints and ideas.
They can teach us about other circles of society, and shed light on new
opportunities to innovate.

Importantly, **Interacting with strangers is one of the best ways to interact
with the social world around you**. Questioning, observing, and experimenting
with the environment are key traits of innovators; this is as true of the social
world as the material world, if not more so. By observing and learning from
strangers, innovative ideas are much more likely to associate in your mind.

Talking to strangers can be nerve-racking. Asking for favors from them can be
even more so. However, these two activities help build risk-taking confidence
and resilience. Practicing getting rejected can help build thick skin and help
you recover from getting rejected by the market, investors, etc in the future.
This practice is known as [Rejection Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_Therapy),
and in my opinion, is a great tool to build resilience.
