title: How Can I More Effectively Innovate?
---

import Quote from '../lib/quote';

I am fortunate enough to already possess some of the traits that make a great
innovator. I am an extremely curious and passionate person, and these two traits
drive my self-learning and experimenting. I often spend hours teaching myself
about new and interesting topics and ideas.

While these traits are beneficial to effectively innovating, they come with
some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is that I can often lack focus. I often
fall victim to [shiny ball syndrome](http://www.boardassociates.org/news/entrepreneurs-shiny-ball-syndrome).
Choosing what not to do, features to not include, and products to not make is 
often as the actions and choices you follow through with. Steve Jobs held simplicity
as an ideal and has worked it into all of Apple's products.

    That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.

To innovate more effectively, I need to learn to narrow my focus and follow one
single idea though not just to completion, but to perfection. Innovations that
are not polished enough to be useful aren't innovations, they are half-complete
side projects.

While I do well with expanding my horizons through self-driven means, I am less
skilled at doing so through networking. A network is not just a thing you have,
it is also a set of skills related to building and maintaining interpersonal
connections. These skills are incredibly [important for innovation](#posts/3-how-do-innovators-think).
Being on the more introverted side of the personality spectrum, there is lots of
room for me to grow in this area. To more effectively innovate, I need to improve
my networking skills and strengthen my existing network.
