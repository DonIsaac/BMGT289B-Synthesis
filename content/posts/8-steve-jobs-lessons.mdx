Steve Jobs was one of the greatest innovators of our time. Even after his tragic passing,
his genius has changed our world and his legacy continues to change it even now.
This legacy also leaves us plenty of lessons, so that we too may become better
innovators. Jobs has taught me that **even when I can't see a use for learning or doing something
that piques my interest, I should persue it anyways**. He reflects on this lesson
in an anecdote about how calligraphy influenced the design of the First Macintosh,
a story he shared during a Stanford commencement speech.

Steve Jobs also taught me to **never stop trying to improve myself, and to keep
taking risks and trying new things, even if it might make me look silly**.
Jobs loved the saying *stay hungry, stay foolish*; a phrase written on the back
of the last edition of a magazine he loved called the *Whole Earth Catalog*.

Another lesson I learned from Jobs is that **simplicity is the ultimate form 
of mastery, and making something simplistic and beautiful is harder than making
something complex**. Knowing what to ignore in a world full of noise requires
mastery in the field where you are innovating. Knowing how to make something 
simple in a way that makes the result masterful and beautiful rather than 
a failure is extremely difficult. Jobs was a master at this, and executed this
perfectly at Apple. I hope that I am able to apply mastery and simplicity in
the same way he was able to when my time comes to innovate.
