title: What Makes Organizations Innovative?

import Video from '../lib/video';

For people, the ability to innovate comes from [how they think](#posts/3-how-do-innovators-think)
and [what they believe](#posts/2-what-does-it-take-to-innovate).
The same is true for organizations. Humans' belief systems live inside their brains,
while organizational belief systems are called something else entirely: Culture.
**Culture and the organizational factors that shape it is the single most 
important factor influencing how innovative an organization is**.
The 3 Ps, **People, Process, and Philosophies**, is a fantastic framework
for understanding what makes an organization innovative. However, I prefer the
framework described in [*The Culture Code*](), which expands on how to construct
the foundations for the 3Ps and goes in-depth into what an innovative culture looks like.

## The Foundation: Safety and Trust

Risk-taking and resilience are requisite for successful innovation.
If an organization does not support risk-taking, or even *punishes* those who
try, each person will enter a "self-preservation" mode and strictly stick to
what they know to be safe. This all starts with management. If managers punish
employees who try something new and fail, employees will stop trying. **Trying
and failing is the lifeblood of innovation**. This kind of discouragement is
effectively equivalent to punishing innovation itself.

Employees must also be able to share ideas and collaborate with colleagues -
the Association and Networking part of
[The Innovator's DNA](https://hbr.org/2009/12/the-innovators-dna) framework.
If employees are pitted against each other, ideas will not spread and people
will not work together. Microsoft learned this the hard way. Before Steve Ballmer
was replaced by Satya Narayana Nadella as CEO for Microsoft, employees were
put into 1 of 5 categories depending on performance. Which category they were 
in affected their pay and employment. Because employees were rated against each
other, it was in each person's best interest to keep their best ideas to themselves
and to backstab others. Innovation is impossible with a culture like that.

## Organizational Structure

How an organization is structured deeply affects its ability to innovate. Innovation
must be baked into the bones of a company, not delegated off to a single department.
Companies with leaders who take responsibility for innovation rather than 
delegate it to others tend to be more innovative.

## People

Human beings are the fundamental building blocks of organizations. The more
talented, creative, and innovative the people who make up the organization are, the 
more talented, creative, and innovative the organization is. Therefore, 
organizations that find and keep the best talent while keeping out mediocre
people find much more success. As they get bigger, organizations tend to hire
unimaginative and mediocre executives - A process Steve Jobs coined as the "[Bozo Explosion](https://simplicable.com/new/bozo-explosion)".
Steve Jobs successfully prevented a Bozo Explosion at Apple by holding
dizzyingly high expectations and by being extremely hard on his employees. While
rather controversial, his strategy was effective, and past employees fondly
remember the greatness Jobs was able to pull out of them.

### Takeaways

Capitalistic ideas that are applied on a societal level do not work within
an organization. This has a few key implications. First, and most importantly,
**Organizations are built on trust and safety, not competition**. Secondly,
**Throwing money at research and development does not make your organization
innovative**. If anything, it only furthers the Bozo Explosion. Financial incentives
do not work; decision-making boards do not work, strict protocol-backed hierarchies
do not work. What works is a culture of trust and safety, where everyone from
the CEO to the lowest level employee actively engages in the innovative process.
This culture must be baked into every part of the organization, from how it is
structured to how people interact with one another.
