**Hello!** My name is **Don Isaac**, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science and Sociology
double major. I enjoy seeking knowledge, puzzles, pottery and finance.
I love to build and design things, and I consider creativity,
passion, and determination to be extremely important. Computers are
some of the most complex systems humanity knows about, and are beat by only
one other kind: Human systems.

I took this class because it looked like an opportunity to learn how to build
a company from nothing, driving it with innovation. I wanted to learn how to
think innovatively in order to combine my knowledge and passion for technology
with entrepreneurship to build businesses.

Before taking this class, I had picked up a book called [**The 10 Types of Innovation**](https://doblin.com/ten-types)
from my local bookstore. I was intrigued. Was it really possible that the seemingly
random act of innovation could be turned into a science? I had to know if it was
possible, and if it was, how to do it. The book was an extremely interesting read,
and sparked my interest in the act of innovating. It was in this mindset that I 
signed up for this class, and little did I know how much we were going to cover,
including the contents of that very book.
