## Distinctive Competencies

With a background, training, and experience in both technical fields and the
humanities, I have a unique combination of skills and abilities. My background
in Computer Science taught me how to create, design, and understand complicated 
software systems, while my Sociology background honed my communication and people
skills. This combination has a number of unique advantages, such as being able to
communicate highly technical concepts to managerial types in a simple, precise, and
accurate way. 

I have also had extensive leadership training and experience. I reached the rank of
Eagle Scout, which is Boy Scout's highest honor for leadership, and I have run
multiple organizations, such as my open source web development organization
[**Open Sourcery**](https://opensourceryumd.com) and a number of business ventures.

This blend of skills, along with some financial and managerial skills, means that
I am exceptionally qualified for running teams of developers, entreprenurship,
and software engineering. Although I have plenty more to learn, my blended
and diverse background makes me a unique and valuable part of a team.


## Assets

I am very fortunate to have a broad array of assets to help me in life, both tangible
and intangible. They are:

- An education from one of the best universities for Computer Science in America;
- A network of talented and modivated friends, acquaintances, and peers;
- A portfolio of investments that can act as starting capital for ventures, etc;
- Multiple powerful computers, internet access, and cloud computing credits.
	

## Aspriations

I have a number of aspirations and wants. They are to:

- Escape the 9-to-5 schedule of a day job and to have control of when, how, and where I work;
- Build and design software that I am passionate about, for a purpose I care about besides
	chasing profits;
- Embark on entreprenurial ventures for the sake of creating products and tools to make the world
	a better place;
- To never let money be a reason why I can't do something (within reason, of course)


## Market Realities

Today's society highly values and heavily relies on technology for everything from
entertainment to keeping up with friends to business management. Tales of college
graduates (and dropouts) heading over to Silicon Valley to make their fortunes
are commonplace. The demand for software engineers far exceeds the
supply, and the demand only keeps growing. This means that I can save
money for starter capital, or fall back onto a well paying job if I need
to.

## Plan A

My plan A is a multi step process to reach the life I want to live. First, I would
secure a software engineering job out of college. As demonstrated above, the
prospects of doing so are very good. Then, I'll take the money I keep after necessities,
rent, taxes, etc. and invest it into cash-flowing real estate. For the next
several years, I would gain experience, build relationships in the industry,
grow my professional network, and expand my real estate portfolio. I will also
use this time to explore opportunities for innovation. When I have enough cash
flow to sustain myself, I will look for the next best innovative opportunity
to execute on. Leveraging my skills and expanded professional network, I will
do this over and over again until one takes off. Considering that I want to
be an entreprenur and not a corporate leader, I would try to sell the business
once it has left the early growth stages and repeat the cycle over again.


## Plan B

My plan B is slightly more conservative than my plan A. There is a high chance
that the innovations I come up with and the businesses I try to start aren't
successful. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about
[half of all new businesses fail within the first five years](https://www.bls.gov/bdm/entrepreneurship/entrepreneurship.htm#chart3).
If I am a part of that half, I will aim to continue to grow my real estate portfolio.
By leveraging favorable tax laws, I will snowball my real estate to the point where
I am making enough money to quit my job and manage real estate full-time.


## Plan Z

If all of that fails, if the worst case scenario for everything happens, I'll
need to fall back onto something secure. Luckly, job security for software 
engineers who are able to learn fast and well is rather good. I'll seek to work
my way up the corporate latter at the company that I am at, changing companies
if need be. I can still invest the extra money I make, and I can use that as a
safty cushion. In class, we learned that job security is a myth nowadays, and
only those who are coninuously learning and growing have any semlance of job
security. Luckly, software engineers are used to this kind of normal, as our
field rapidly changes all the time. On top of this, I love to learn, so I should
be able to stay ahead of the curve. As long as I can do that, I should be okay.
