# BMGT 289B Course Synthesis

This repository is the website I built for BMGT 289B - "How Do Innovators Think?"
at the University of Maryland using Gatsby and MDX.

## Usage

You will need the gatsby CLI tool in order to compile this website. Gatsby can
be installed via npm. If you do not have Node.js and npm installed, you can
download them [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To install the gatsby CLI, run

```
npm i -g gatsby
```

To build the website with gatsby, run
```
git clone https://github.com/DonIsaac/BMGT289B-Synthesis.git
cd BMGT289B-Synthesis
npm i
npm start
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`. To make
a production build, run

```
gatsby build
```
